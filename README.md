# synthwave-themed-sites
Stylus theme to make website synthwavy

Based on the excellent [robb0wen's VSCode Synthwave theme](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode) 

For now, I ported the theme for [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs)

More to come if I need them ;) 




You can install these themes with the Stylus plugin: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/styl-us/) [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=fr)
